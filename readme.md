# SmartLLM Framework

SmartLLM is an abstract framework for leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to create intelligent applications.

## Overview

This framework provides a flexible structure for building AI-powered tools and applications using state-of-the-art language models.

## Key Concepts

1. **Abstract Interfaces**: Define high-level interfaces for interacting with LLMs, allowing for easy swapping of underlying models or providers.

2. **Task-Specific Modules**: Implement specialized modules for various tasks such as text generation, summarization, question-answering, etc.

3. **Workflow Management**: Orchestrate complex AI workflows by chaining multiple LLM operations.

4. **Context Handling**: Manage and manipulate context efficiently to improve the quality of LLM outputs.

5. **Prompt Engineering**: Utilities for creating, testing, and optimizing prompts for different use cases.

## Example Use Cases

The SmartLLM framework can be used to build a wide range of applications, such as:

- Content generation systems
- Intelligent chatbots
- Automated research assistants
- Code generation and analysis tools
- Language translation services

## Getting Started

To use the SmartLLM framework, import the necessary modules and define your specific use case.

## Example

```python
from smartllm.functions import create_book

book = create_book("Artificial Intelligence")
print(book)
```
